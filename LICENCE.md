TotalFreedomMod by Madgeek1450 and DarthSalamon is an effort to create an opensource plugin to effectively run a "Total Freedom" like all-Op server. The plugin has been worked on further by the entire of the CJFreedom Development team and is lead by Wild1145 and strongly assisted by HeXeRei452. It consists of over 95 custom coded commands and a large variety of distinguishable features not included in any other plugin. The plugin has since its beginning grown immensely. Together with the main server "TotalFreedom" (http://totalfreedom.me) TotalFreedomMod has a long-standing reputation of effectiveness whilst maintaining a clear feel of openness towards the administrators and the players themselves.

## License

TotalFreedomMod sourcecode is freely available under the GNU GPLv3 License with a few restrictions in place. The license is available here: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt

The few restrictions are in place to make sure that credit is given to the original authors who remain the maintainers of the plugin and it's sourcecode.

These are the restrictions under which the sourcecode is licensed:
  * A un-edited copy of this license must always be included with this sourcecode.
  * TotalFreedomMod sourcecode and its derrivations are freely distributable between anyone who choses to download it.
  * You may not remove the keywords "Madgeek1450", "StevenLawson", "DarthSalamon", "jeromsar", "Wild1145", "RyanWild", "HeXeRei452" "DanJones" and "CJFreedom" from any part of the sourcecode.
  * However, compiled binaries (*.jar's) are not to be distributed. If you wish to obtain a copy of TotalFreedomMod you must compile the original sourcecode or it's derivations yourself using an IDE like netbeans. Official superadmins and above of the TotalFreedom (totalfreedom.me) server  may obtain a compiled libary with the same limitations as described in this document.
  * Any admins on the CJFreedom server may request a copy of the custom build by contacting the chief developer (Wild1145) who will be able to send you a copy when needed, this is because we change it so often that its not easy to keep a working copy publicly avalable at all times.
  * Any conditions on this license may be waived by any of the official developers.
  * Any extra conditions that have been added by the  CJFreedom development team are able to be waived by Wild1145 only.
